####FoodTruckProject

###Description
In this program, we had the user input the data of 1-5 food trucks, including the name of the food truck, types of foods served at the truck, the and the user's rating from 1-10.
Then the program showed the information of all the trucks, the average rating, and the highest rated food truck in a menu format.
###Lessons Learned
I need to have a better understanding of static, public, and getters and setters. However, the logic used in the program came much easier to me compared to last weeks project. I believe that was from repeated exposure of the problems. I feel much better about where I was from Friday; just two days of working on this project helped me clear up a lot of questions. I have a much more solid understanding of arrays, and for loops as well.
###Technologies Used
From the top down, I used scanner, for loops, .equals, .equalsIgnoreCase(which was a first for me), if/else statements, while loops, switches, and encapsulation.
###What Was Fun
I always have a good time setting up the menus for a program. Having a user input something, and having that affect something in the program gives me a bit of a dopamine rush. Due to my tendency to zone out during class, I had to do a bit of research and studying on some of the topics we used in this program. But doing that research was fulfilling and helped me gain a much better understanding of all of the technologies used in class and in this program.
